# newAlumni

I developed **newAlumni** as my final project during the web developement bootcamp at [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/) in spring 2020.

The idea of newAlumni is to connect newcomer of the web development bootcamp with former bootcamp students.

With newAlumni you can create a profile to let others know about your current job, your contact details as well as your capstone project and further projects on github.

## Preview

newAlumni is hosted via firebase.

Switch your browser to responsive mode (iPhone 6/7/8 plus) as this app was designed for mobile usage.
